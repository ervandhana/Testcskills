Which of following statements is declaration and which is a definition?
  extern int i;
  int j;
  
Answer : 
        extern int i; //Declaration
        int j;  //Definition
        
What is the difference between Declaration and definition?

1. A variable definition tells the compiler where (Memory section - stack, heap, code and data) and how much storage to create for the variable.
  eg: int i,j,k;
2. The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k; which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
3. Memory will be allocated

1. A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable.
  eg: extern int a, b;
2. A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files.
3. Memory will not be allocated during declaration

          Definition                            Declaration
          
1. Space is reserved for variable and       Identifies the type of variable
some initial value given to it
2.Variable is created and assigned for      Refers to places and where the nature of variable 
storage                                     is stated but no storage is allocated
3. Redifinition is error                    Redeclaration not ana error
